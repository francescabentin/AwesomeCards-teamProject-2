# Presentation cards

This is a responsive website for business cards, created with the help of a great team of developers.

## How the Website Works:
1. We start with the homepage of our website where we need to click on the "Start" button.
2. On the next page, we have fields to fill out and design our business card, which consists of:

    * Design
        - We choose the color palette in which we want our business card to be displayed.
    * Fill
        - Comprised of form fields, where we need to fill them out as indicated in the examples and add a photo.
        - It allows us to link our social media profiles so that people can contact us: phonenumber, email, Github, and Linkedin.
    * Share
        - The final step, where if all the fields are filled out, it allows us to create the business card, giving us a unique web link for each card that can be shared on Twitter.

Above the business card, we can find the reset button, which when pressed will clear all the fields we have filled out, and we would need to start over.

## How We Structured the Project:
We have created different files to work independently within the project.

### HTML Structure:
We have divided the HTML into three sections, as follows:
1. Head
2. Main
3. Main created: for the card creation part.
    * Preview
    * Design
    * Fill
    * Share
4. Footer

### Languages We Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS: with SCSS nesting.
   * Flexbox
   * Animation in some elements
3. JavaScript
   * Variables (created in JavaScript or retrieved from HTML)
   * Fetch to send data to the server/API
   * Functions
   * Condicionals
   * Events
